# Microbiome
This repository is for files, information and code associated with two Rainbow Darter Microbiome projects run by Victoria Restivo, Karen Kidd and Joanna Wilson.  The first project was a field study with samples collected from the Grand River at sites upstream and downstream of the Kitchener and Waterloo wastewater treatment plants (Ontario, Canada).  The second was a lab study with fish collected upstream of the wastewater treatment plants on the Grand River, brought to the lab, sampled in the field, after acclimation, and from a 28 day exposure to control, wastewater effluent, or the antimicrobial triclosan.  In both studies, the gut content was collected for microbiome analyses.  Extraction and sequencing was completed in the lab of Mike Surette and the Farncombe Institute (Hamilton, Ontario).  Field sampling was done in collaboration and with the support of Mark Servos' lab.  Carol Bucking collaborated with us on the lab study.
